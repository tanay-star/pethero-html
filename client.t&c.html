                  The Platform provides telehealth Services through the Consult
                  Now and Video Consult module which involve the delivery of
                  veterinary medical services and veterinary health care
                  services using interactive audio and video technology over the
                  Platform (including but not limited to text messaging, online
                  chat, and digital video conferencing), to provide real-time
                  visual of the Pet and interface with the Practitioner on audio
                  and video to complete the Consultation process (hereinafter

                  The Client may also be allowed to send written notes to the
                  Practitioner using a secure In-app Texting module within the
                  Platform (“In-app Texting module”). The messages sent over the
                  In-app Texting module can be viewed by the Practitioner to
                  whom the message was sent and will typically be answered
                  within forty eight [48] hours. However, the Client should not
                  rely on the In-app Texting module in need of immediate
                  attention from a Practitioner. If Client’s pet is experiencing
                  a medical emergency, the Client should contact the nearest
                  Veterinary Clinic or Hospital. The Client understands and
                  agrees that messaging with Practitioner over the In-app
                  Texting module does not give rise to a provider-patient
                  relationship, and does not by itself constitute treatment,
                  diagnosis, or medical advice.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Company will ensure the Client is provided confirmed
                  appointment on the Platform. However, the Company has no
                  liability if such an appointment is later cancelled by the
                  Practitioner, or the same Practitioner is not available for
                  appointment.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Platform enables the Client to select and schedule
                  appointments with the Practitioners available on the Platform.

                  Practitioner’s Profiles who may be suitable to deliver the
                  Services.

                  The results of any search performed by the Client on the
                  Platform for Practitioners should not be construed as an
                  endorsement by the Company of any such particular
                  Practitioner. If the Client decides to engage with a
                  Practitioner to seek Services, the Client shall be doing so at
                  his/her own risk. The Company does not make any
                  representations or warranties with respect to these
                  Practitioners or the quality of the Services they may provide
                  to the Client.

                  or reports of their Pet with the Practitioner promptly upon
                  request. For every paid consultation on the Platform, the
                  Client shall not obtain consultation for more than one Pet.
                  The Client attempting to obtain consultation for more than one
                  Pet through a single paid consultation on the Platform is a
                  breach of these Pet Hero Client Terms and Conditions and such
                  consultations will not be addressed by the relevant
                  Practitioner. The Company reserves the right to charge
                  additional fees and the Client shall make the additional
                  payment without disputing such a claim.
