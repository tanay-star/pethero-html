                  Texting module does not give rise to a provider-patient
                  relationship, and does not by itself constitute treatment,
                  diagnosis, or medical advice.

                  or reports of their Pet with the Practitioner promptly upon
                  request. For every paid consultation on the Platform, the
                  Client shall not obtain consultation for more than one Pet.
                  The Client attempting to obtain consultation for more than one
                  Pet through a single paid consultation on the Platform is a
                  breach of these Pet Hero Client Terms and Conditions and such
                  consultations will not be addressed by the relevant
                  Practitioner. The Company reserves the right to charge
                  additional fees and the Client shall make the additional
                  payment without disputing such a claim.
