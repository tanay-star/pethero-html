                  Ensure that the Client consults the same Practitioner with
                  whom the appointment has been confirmed. If Practitioner is

                    <li>Change in Practitioner’s consultation timings</li>
                  </ol>
                </li>
              </ol>
              In event of the Practitioner is unable or facing any issues in

              Company’s administration team at hello@pethero.io.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Practitioner has the discretion to cancel any consultation at
              any point in time in cases where the Practitioner feels that it is
              beyond his/her expertise or his/her capacity to treat the Client’s
              Pet by providing appropriate explanation to the Client which shall
              include for further evaluation. However, the Practitioner
              understands that the Client shall be eligible for refund policy
              for any of the acts mentioned under the below clause.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Practitioner understands and agrees that the Client shall be
              eligible for the refund of the consultation fee or any financial
              assistance in occurrence of the following incidents, in relation
              to the Services provided by the Platform, in the event of the
              Practitioner not attending a Scheduled Appointment Time, within
              <ol type="i">
                <li>

              Further in case of Consult Now, if the Practitioner needs to
              change the status to &#39;unavailable&#39;, the same could be
              changed after having completed all the open consultations. In case
              the Practitioner leaves a consultation open and changes the status
              to &#39;unavailable&#39;, the Practitioner understands and agrees
              that he/she shall be liable to pay such penalty as may be imposed
              by the Company, in these cases. The Company will inform the
              respective Practitioner by way of a written notice with reference
              to the approved refund request. The Practitioner shall pay
              refundable fee to the Client within seven (07) days. In event of
              the refundable fee is paid by the Company to the Client, the same
              shall be deducted from the Practitioner payment (if any) and/or
              the Practitioner shall pay the fee with additional penalty (if
              applicable) to the Company within seven (07) days of receipt of
              such notice.
